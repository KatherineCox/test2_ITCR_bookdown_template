## Account Setup

This guide provides an opinionated walkthrough on how to set up AnVIL for your lab, based on experiences from many labs actively using AnVIL.  Following our recommendations will help you configure your team so that you can more clearly see where charges are coming from and have greater control over which users can spend your money and access your data.

### Goals for this guide

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="List of goals for this guide: 1) get your accounts, 2) set up billing, 3) set up your lab members to do research on AnVIL, and 4) monitor and manage spending."}

### Overview

AnVIL uses [Terra](https://anvil.terra.bio/) to run analyses.  Terra operates on Google Cloud Platform, so youâ€™ll pay for all storage and analysis costs through a Google account linked to Terra.  The costs are the standard Google Cloud Platform fees for storing and moving data as well as executing an analysis.  These costs are passed along through Terra without any markup.
